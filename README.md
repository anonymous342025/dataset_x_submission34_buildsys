# dataset_x_submission34_buildsys
DatasetX, an IoT dataset for evaluating smart building systems in the wild. Below, we showcase a schematic of the data collection process for the dataset and hint at its aim to facilitate evaluating building systems that posses 'smart modules', i.e., solutions that try to move away from passive monitoring toward providing insight about the building or ways to actuate (influence) its state.

## Data
Data can be found under `DatasetX`.


## Reproducibility
We provide instructions on how to reproduce the numbers and experiments in the paper. For use-case 1, navigate to [1_use_case/README.md](https://github.com/anonymous342025/dataset_x_submission34_buildsys/blob/main/reproducibility/code/1_use_case/README.md). For use-case 2, navigate to [2_use_case/README.md](https://github.com/anonymous342025/dataset_x_submission34_buildsys/blob/main/reproducibility/code/2_use_case/README.md).

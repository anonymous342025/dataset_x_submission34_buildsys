# Running code for Use case 1 experiment
This will reproduce Table 3 and Figure 4 from the paper.

## Install reqs
Create a venv using `python3 -m venv env`, subsequently activate it `source env/bin/activate`, and `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Run `training.py` (takes roughly 5 minutes to obtain results)
Assuming you have set up your venv, to run the code, simply execute `python training.py`

## Run `figure_3.py`
Assuming you have set up your venv, to run the code, simply execute `python figure_3.py`
